# Housing Prices
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
- You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.
- The business problem that this project is trying to solve is which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and how well those variables describe the price of a house.
- The project also wants to determine the vaue of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The variables that are significant in predicting the price of house are 'Membran', 'WdShngl', 'BsmtFinSF1', 'BsmtFinSF2', 'BsmtUnfSF','TotalBsmtSF', '1stFlrSF', '2ndFlrSF', 'LowQualFinSF', 'GrLivArea'.
- Value of lambda for ridge regression is 10.
- Value of lambda for lasso regression is 100.
